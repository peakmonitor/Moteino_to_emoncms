# Moteino_to_emoncms
Code to read Honeywell HSC or SSC pressure sensor using Moteino (Arduino clone from LowPowerLabs), then send to emonHub and ultimately emoncms.  
Code adapted from EmonTX example sketch available as part of the OpenEnergyMonitor.org project.

Uses RFM12B version of Moteino, haven't tried RFM69W yet.
